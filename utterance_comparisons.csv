mathias,devin,1,2,"And we're on. Welcome to this conversation of the Local Voices Network. We're grateful that you decided to join us. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationship with one another. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift or lift up the voices and the needs of the community to the candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. This conversation will be recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. We'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion. Our goal eventually is to make them assessable to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator, or the Local Voices Network to use their recording in accordance with their missions and fostering conversations in communities, and in the media to improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in our local newspapers or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear somewhere else including other forms of media. So please don't say anything you wouldn't want heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say I agree and we'll just go one by one.",I agree.,1,0.9048374180359595,0.14893731474876404,0.1347640553264807
mathias,devin,9,12,"Perfect. If you'd like to listen to some of the other discussions that are happening around the city, we'll ask you to provide your contact information at end of the session. I'll just pass around this. This is totally optional. If you do provide your information it will be kept confidential and will not be tied in any way to today's recording. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation. And to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also in the handouts in front of you, so please turn off all devices including cell phones and smartwatches. I just did my watch. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Allow us to finish speaking and take turns. Stay curious. Ask honest questions. Pause. Take time to reflect. Listen generously, assume good intentions while acknowledging and attempting to impact, and be aware that even well intention comments may be hurtful to others in this group. Is everybody on board with these guidelines?","Yeah. My name's Devin. I use he, him, his pronouns. And just a little bit about me, I'm a very good community organizer.

mathias,devin,21,24,"All right. So right now this next thing we would like to do is, I invite you to share a little bit about your background. Take a minute to think about a personal story from your life that has shaped who you are and what help others understand what's important to you. If it helps, you can reflect on that value. Just select them in the last round and think of a story that illustrates a time when this value has either challenged, or reinforced you. We will go again once. We will just go again once again around the table and just share our story and as a reminder, you're invited to share a personal story that will help other people understand what's important to you. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you don't say anything that you wouldn't want the public to know, or just be open to the community.

I was at a point where I was seeking some random college courses, because extra science to IGBA, two are to work out. And something just spoke to me in this space of, in this intro argument class about, ""Oh well, if black people are in this situation maybe they should do this."" And I was like, ""Whoa, you're white."" And I'm sure I have a pretty good sense of your exposure of people of color, and that is a terrible and downright offensive statement. So I figured I would rather choose my own narrative, and put myself in a position where I can speak for myself and maybe for some others, if they would allow me to defend them and their right to do or to operate however they would want. So that's what I did. And then I made some statements in that class, and from then on it somewhat got troubling like saying that there was no such thing as reverse racism, because it has to do with power and privilege. Then I applied that to sexism and then I applied that to sports. And while I'm not like the perfect example of a human being, I just addressed some things, and then people really got upset about that. But I noticed that I had facts and evidence and I'm usually an opinionated person. So when I have that going for me, at least I'm controlling the narrative and you would get like, ""Cool, we can like discuss about that."" But I know I'm right.

mathias,devin,74,77,"Three. So I just have two more questions. All right, here it would be essentially, I let the conversation go a little longer, because I couldn't bring that voice. But within the conversation will allow you guys to essentially react to that conversation. And then the next part essentially is, here is just a question from my reflection, but given our conversation today, what is the hope? What do you hope is different about your life here five years from now? And then we can just go around real quick.","What I would want in five years, first of all, leaves. And then second of all, probably either invest, and then buy and change the structure of a lot of businesses that didn't hire me, and then be like cool, thank you. Now I own you. Cool, how does it feel now. Cool. And then encourage other people set up or highlight mentorship programs. Because I have a lot of people that are interested in whether that's fitness or music, and taking the time for them to really invest in their dreams and objectives and hold themselves accountable in that sense. And then just don't worry about anything else. Like for me, I do want to leave, but there's certain stuff that I have to focus on first, so I'm focusing on that first. So everybody does that. Cool. If you want to stay, cool. Just make sure that you have certain dreams and objectives outside of your day job, and highlight that to everybody to make sure we have equity instead of just equality.

mathias,keetra,38,41,Thank you for sharing.,"I can go first. I would say I live in Madison and I like Madison because I believe in the possibility of Madison becoming the city that we all want it to be. And what I mean by that is, right now of course there is a tale of two cities, but I think we've reached a spot where people are now aware that there's a tale of two cities, or they are now validated in knowing for a long time that there is a tale of two cities. And in my work I come across a lot of organizational leaders, a lot of people in public office, a lot of everyday people. And what I see time and time again is especially like in smaller groups like this, is that, and I've mentioned this in a speech recently, that we are all able to connect on a human level. We know what's right, we know what looks right, what feels right. And if you think back to the incident where the school behavioral specialists body-slammed a little black girl and snatch braids out of her head regardless of any policy or practice, we know we wouldn't want that to happen to our child. On a human level, that's wrong. It doesn't matter who wrote what policy and what's in place. So I think we're all able to connect and know what the right thing to do is. I think that our challenge is realizing that people, everyday people in our community, make up the systems that interfere with us becoming the city that we want to be. And what I mean by that is, in that same scenario, the school district says, well this person was practicing in line with his role and responsibilities in the school district, so he can't be terminated. We'll refer it to the Madison Police Department. The Police Department says, well, if the School District says he didn't do anything wrong, he didn't break any laws. So there's nothing we can do as a Police Department, we'll refer to the District Attorney's Office. The District Attorney's Office says, well if the police didn't file any charges, there's nothing we can do, because we can't take any legal action. So everybody is pointing the finger at the next person or the next entity as the reason why. But in pointing those fingers we're ultimately pointing our fingers at ourselves, because we made those policies and practices. So I think that once we realize that we are the systems, we are the people who make up the policies and the practices, and it's our relationships, and our friendships, and our professional networks that create this brick wall that we all keep on bump our heads up against, until we realize that we're just going to continue passing the ball. We just have to be brave enough. Like I tell all leaders, this requires brave leadership. People who are not afraid to be disliked, to make those bold calls, to make those really brave choices. That change things to the point where we don't have those excuses or reasons why we can't do X, Y, Z anymore, but we work together to make sure that the right thing is accomplished basically. I believe in our ability to get there. It's frustrating. It's frustrating just to see us continue to bump up against that system and people to see that as the end all be all. It's frustrating for me to see people who are in agreement that change needs to happen until they have to sacrifice something, or something is taken away from that particular person or group of people. There was a quote once that really hit me. It said, when you're accustomed to privilege, equity feels like oppression. So in other words, if you're used to being spoonfed and having your way, when it's time to make sure that everyone has what they need, it feels like something's being taken away from you. But the fact that you had more in the first place is what was wrong all the time. So yeah, that's what I think.",3,0.7408182206817179,0.136971116065979,0.10147069848878763

I believe in our ability to get there. It's frustrating. It's frustrating just to see us continue to bump up against that system and people to see that as the end all be all. It's frustrating for me to see people who are in agreement that change needs to happen until they have to sacrifice something, or something is taken away from that particular person or group of people. There was a quote once that really hit me. It said, when you're accustomed to privilege, equity feels like oppression. So in other words, if you're used to being spoonfed and having your way, when it's time to make sure that everyone has what they need, it feels like something's being taken away from you. But the fact that you had more in the first place is what was wrong all the time. So yeah, that's what I think.",1,0.9048374180359595,0.3630560338497162,0.3285066842709531

And the two questions that you can either choose to answer both, or one or the other is, first one, what do you like most about living here? Share a story from your experience that will help us give a better picture of what you like and why. And then the other question is what most concerns you about life in this community these days?

Like I said, I grew up in a small town, so had kind of a tunnel vision, and how can I expand that to help the work that we do here, and to broaden my awareness and knowledge.

I'm like me, I'm gone for three days and then I want to come home. So that's something wild in my eyes. So the reason I chose honesty, one, I'm a pretty blunt person, so I do like to live that value the best I can. And I think it comes from growing up. It's so weird. Don, your story is kind of similar to mine when you started saying that. I don't know my real dad and my mom has never addressed it. It's like something I don't even know. It's like it's never brought up. So then when I was 18 you're given your birth certificate and I did a bunch of research, et cetera. But where I'm going with that is this whole time that I've been growing up, it's like my mom doesn't see me as an adult or like didn't see that she could tell me these things. And really that kind of stemmed over into her just kind of being hands off as a parent in general. So I just, I don't know. I really value honesty because I think if she could talk to me and tell me about it, I feel I deserve that. I deserve to be told what happened and I haven't been, and I just, I don't know. I think that that's where a lot of my being blunt and being open and just talk to people like they're humans, you know? It's also very uncomfortable for me to share.

mathias,jalanda,56,60,How about this side of the room?,"I, let's see... One of the biggest things is, has been my personal experience and going through the experience with my kids through the Madison School District. I can talk about that for days on end. I would say with my youngest ones right now, the parts I am most struggling with, because my two oldest are girls and my two youngest are boys. So their experience with academics have been completely different. So I always feel like I have to start off the year in a much different way in explaining their learning styles, their interests, how to get them engaged. And this year has probably been the most receptive year, and the teachers actually listening and trying some of the suggestions versus being in a space where it's pulling tug with the kid. And I would say like that first week we kind of have my third grader, his teacher called me and we had this very long conversation. Very, very long conversation, but by the end of it I haven't heard from her since, so everything that I've kind of suggested and helped her have a better understanding of just him, his personality, how he learns best, and she actually was receptive and heard me and implemented this stuff. It's been completely different. Like she used, he comes to school every day, he might sit there but he's like, I hate this flat out. I hate this. I don't want to be here. Now it's like he comes home. How was your day at school? I hate it, but I did it. I'm participating correctly. That's all I ask. But it's more or less kind of, it has been my experience, it's a lack of understanding or the cultural differences and not taking the time to be curious enough to inquire about those. I would say with the girls it's been a lot of preconceived ideas or notions and having those challenged, and then having to deal with the social dynamics of school.

mathias,jalanda,59,60,Authenticity.,"I, let's see... One of the biggest things is, has been my personal experience and going through the experience with my kids through the Madison School District. I can talk about that for days on end. I would say with my youngest ones right now, the parts I am most struggling with, because my two oldest are girls and my two youngest are boys. So their experience with academics have been completely different. So I always feel like I have to start off the year in a much different way in explaining their learning styles, their interests, how to get them engaged. And this year has probably been the most receptive year, and the teachers actually listening and trying some of the suggestions versus being in a space where it's pulling tug with the kid. And I would say like that first week we kind of have my third grader, his teacher called me and we had this very long conversation. Very, very long conversation, but by the end of it I haven't heard from her since, so everything that I've kind of suggested and helped her have a better understanding of just him, his personality, how he learns best, and she actually was receptive and heard me and implemented this stuff. It's been completely different. Like she used, he comes to school every day, he might sit there but he's like, I hate this flat out. I hate this. I don't want to be here. Now it's like he comes home. How was your day at school? I hate it, but I did it. I'm participating correctly. That's all I ask. But it's more or less kind of, it has been my experience, it's a lack of understanding or the cultural differences and not taking the time to be curious enough to inquire about those. I would say with the girls it's been a lot of preconceived ideas or notions and having those challenged, and then having to deal with the social dynamics of school. There's something, it burns my skin. So my second oldest daughter's only in fourth grade now. So in second grade she came home one day.

Just select them in the last round and think of a story that illustrates a time when this value has either challenged, or reinforced you. We will go again once. We will just go again once again around the table and just share our story and as a reminder, you're invited to share a personal story that will help other people understand what's important to you. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you don't say anything that you wouldn't want the public to know, or just be open to the community. Right here, I'll open up the floor and whoever would like to take it.","I was sharing a story. I'm from the South, so we grew up as sharecroppers for the first 12 years of our lives. So that means that we did not have a place over our head that we controlled. So, share crop as you worked the land of where you lived, and so we had very humble beginnings. The place were without no running water, no bathroom. You can get water from the spring and did that for a long time. And what you realize is that every day that you're dependent, that where you live depends on how much work you do in terms of what the owners, of picking cotton and grapes and whatever they have asked us to do. And I remember this one day my father was always working two jobs plus doing the work that Atlanta would ask. And so one day, it was a Saturday, and the owner had come and demanded that my father do some work. And I was about seven or eight and my father looked at him and told him no, my father was an old, tough guy. And so he was in the army, so he had a knife with him. He told the man, if he gets out of this truck, that will be his last move of the day. And I watched my father as his knife popped out. And this man, looked at my father, my father looked at him, and he did not get out of the truck. He got back in the truck and he left. And I remember thinking, because my father told me about, you have to draw a line in the sand and sometimes stand your ground and say that enough is enough. So the next day, you have to understand the South back then, is that it was very segregated and they did not give blacks much in terms of that. But the next day 25 white kids marched on our house as a protest for my father who refused to work. Now I'm from a family that's pretty tough. And so as they approached on, one of my sisters asked who was the leader, and he was once spoke up, she kind of whacked him with a poken and he went down, and then somebody else said something, and she whacked him down. And then they all left and we thought, well, either we have caused some problems or whatever. I used to be.. My sis, I thought she was going to come out and do some negotiation. She just took him out and I said, maybe you shouldn't have used the iron. Just ask him who the leader was. She took out two of them. She goes, yes, I would have taken out more. But it's that, meaning the understanding is that you have to fight for yourself. And they didn't bother us anymore after that, they just decided that my sister was kind of crazy and that you probably should leave these folks alone, and that my father would be willing to take people out. So it was like, okay. And it taught me a lesson about I have learn to stand my ground. And as a person of color, I've had to do a lot of that. When I said, I have to stand alone about what I believe in and I will fight for it until the day of the time and that you have to take me out. And they said, what do you mean by that? I said, I mean take me out, because I will defend myself. And that lesson as a seven, eight year old, is really stuck with me even to this day, even though we're in different times. There were moments where you feel like you are under assault, because somebody decides not to treat you as an equal. So that's my story and it's deep within my DNA and I still think about it.",1,0.9048374180359595,0.3895697593688965,0.3524972952122423
mathias,claude,36,39,Do you want to go?,"You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life.

mathias,claude,38,39,Thank you for sharing.,"You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?""

devin,mathias,52,56,"Well, what I enjoy about Madison is the convenience. Going anywhere else, I hate traffic. So that's like the one privilege where I'm like, yes, no traffic. I know where everything is for the most part. So that's the convenient part that I really enjoy. The part that I wish Madison maybe could be improved on is exposure of other communities because if you go five hours away to the twin cities, there is a level of exposure that you can only get from being there and from living there. Like you would have to live there for at least like two to three months to know what authentic community action can look like and would look like. There was a protest recently where the president came in and honestly I was like, why did I move so soon? I could have been there with one of my friends. But at the same time I knew I left, because I didn't want to pay rent and for a couple of other reasons, but I did miss that authenticity and there was just a level of community action diversity that was really authentic. Like you can talk to a random person and sure enough you both might be in a similar same circle. And you know, there's just some things that I wish I could take from that exposure to open it to hear. And there's a level of accountability and responsibility that a lot of different generations that you may not see, have going on. Especially in youth work. It's definitely not highlighted here. It's definitely not the norm here. Even when I talk to my friends, it's like, oh, you're not holding yourself accountable on that. Okay. All right, cool. That's different. I got used to that. So it's just like, why are we not doing this? Like how do you expect to make change if you can't hold your own actions accountable? Because when you're responsible for somebody else or somebody else's kids, that elevates it. So, that's what I'm seeing. I guess a lack of teaching, how accountability can actually make you successful and can make change. It just starts with you. And it honestly starts with you, like you can go see a therapist or get analyzed by somebody or go back to whatever source you came from for your motivation for your why. But yeah, that's what I feel like would need to be changed more authentically. And in terms of the media, a lot of these things quite honestly, I guess Madison is still dealing with those issues. But to me now, those issues are a little bit old and now it's more of like the instant gratification of RI. You know what goes really on in a police man's daily life, how do we change that? Do we have open honest conversation? Like do we need as many police, or do we need police in schools period. Like really, you really can't handle black kids, really? You think that's hard. No it's not that bad. Just make yourself entertaining, change up the system. Have these conversations, at least start with that. And you know if you want more information, go hire somebody that is actually an expert. So when I hear these things I'm really like, wow, we're on this? There's so many different little issues. Once you get to that level and then don't illusion yourself. Once you learn more and once you get more exposure, you think, oh man, I made progress. So much more intergenerational, intercultural, there's just so much more that can happen. So I guess that's another thing of saying, we call it journey to change things.

So it's just like, why are we not doing this? Like how do you expect to make change if you can't hold your own actions accountable? Because when you're responsible for somebody else or somebody else's kids, that elevates it. So, that's what I'm seeing. I guess a lack of teaching, how accountability can actually make you successful and can make change. It just starts with you. And it honestly starts with you, like you can go see a therapist or get analyzed by somebody or go back to whatever source you came from for your motivation for your why. But yeah, that's what I feel like would need to be changed more authentically. And in terms of the media, a lot of these things quite honestly, I guess Madison is still dealing with those issues. But to me now, those issues are a little bit old and now it's more of like the instant gratification of RI. You know what goes really on in a police man's daily life, how do we change that? Do we have open honest conversation? Like do we need as many police, or do we need police in schools period. Like really, you really can't handle black kids, really? You think that's hard. No it's not that bad. Just make yourself entertaining, change up the system. Have these conversations, at least start with that. And you know if you want more information, go hire somebody that is actually an expert. So when I hear these things I'm really like, wow, we're on this? There's so many different little issues. Once you get to that level and then don't illusion yourself. Once you learn more and once you get more exposure, you think, oh man, I made progress. So much more intergenerational, intercultural, there's just so much more that can happen. So I guess that's another thing of saying, we call it journey to change things. You just have to let it, like it's going to be never ending. So really strap it.",Change is constant.,1,0.9048374180359595,0.21352550387382507,0.19320586561001915

devin,claude,52,55,"Well, what I enjoy about Madison is the convenience. Going anywhere else, I hate traffic. So that's like the one privilege where I'm like, yes, no traffic. I know where everything is for the most part. So that's the convenient part that I really enjoy. The part that I wish Madison maybe could be improved on is exposure of other communities because if you go five hours away to the twin cities, there is a level of exposure that you can only get from being there and from living there. Like you would have to live there for at least like two to three months to know what authentic community action can look like and would look like. There was a protest recently where the president came in and honestly I was like, why did I move so soon? I could have been there with one of my friends. But at the same time I knew I left, because I didn't want to pay rent and for a couple of other reasons, but I did miss that authenticity and there was just a level of community action diversity that was really authentic. Like you can talk to a random person and sure enough you both might be in a similar same circle. And you know, there's just some things that I wish I could take from that exposure to open it to hear. And there's a level of accountability and responsibility that a lot of different generations that you may not see, have going on. Especially in youth work. It's definitely not highlighted here.

When I was a kid growing up, if you walked in the room and didn't hello, you get popped, period. That's it. Like who are you? You want you... Who do you? You say hi to everybody in here.

And she was like, ""Oh my girl, what's wrong with you?"" She's like, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""I just said, Hey Kelly"" and you all like, she's like, ""Oh, I said hi, you didn't hear me?""

And we have to tell them to teach their friends like when you enter a house, you greet people, you say hello, and it's so hard to learn. I don't get it, but that's... When I was a kid growing up, if you walked in the room and didn't hello, you get popped, period. That's it. Like who are you? You want you... Who do you? You say hi to everybody in here. And so just today, I was in the first of my businesses that I'm prepping this food for this meeting, like Kelly came in, and I'll say, ""Hey."" I was like, ""Hey Kelly."" And she was like, ""Oh my girl, what's wrong with you?"" She's like, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""I just said, Hey Kelly"" and you all like, she's like, ""Oh, I said hi, you didn't hear me?"" And I'm thinking like first of all, no you didn't, but okay, now we're where we need to be. And then we had a little brief conversation, but it's cultural, right? So I can't hold that against her, because she didn't grow up the way that I grew up. But we, it's... There's so many opportunities for us to learn from it. Like, I speak to Steve all the time. It's like, ""Hey."" He's like, ""Hey."" But now to know that you're in an elevator and you don't speak to people like, okay. Right. That's who Steve is and that's how he was raised. So our differences, and sharing our differences is what makes us greater. But with technology and with how quick we're trying to move and do things in the world, we don't stop to take advantage of those opportunities, because we're too busy.","Three.

And so I was just partnership with them so we can use this technology to help with us, because I won't to go to a hundred conversations, write a hundred possible notes and do a hundred all of that. So I think it's going to be great. And the next step in that partnership is for us to get together with members of the LVN team to figure out how we can tweak the buttons in this group to make sure we're related to the United Way. Hundred years ago, a hundred years into the future and that's our next step.

Going anywhere else, I hate traffic. So that's like the one privilege where I'm like, yes, no traffic. I know where everything is for the most part. So that's the convenient part that I really enjoy. The part that I wish Madison maybe could be improved on is exposure of other communities because if you go five hours away to the twin cities, there is a level of exposure that you can only get from being there and from living there. Like you would have to live there for at least like two to three months to know what authentic community action can look like and would look like. There was a protest recently where the president came in and honestly I was like, why did I move so soon? I could have been there with one of my friends. But at the same time I knew I left, because I didn't want to pay rent and for a couple of other reasons, but I did miss that authenticity and there was just a level of community action diversity that was really authentic. Like you can talk to a random person and sure enough you both might be in a similar same circle. And you know, there's just some things that I wish I could take from that exposure to open it to hear. And there's a level of accountability and responsibility that a lot of different generations that you may not see, have going on. Especially in youth work. It's definitely not highlighted here. It's definitely not the norm here. Even when I talk to my friends, it's like, oh, you're not holding yourself accountable on that. Okay. All right, cool. That's different. I got used to that. So it's just like, why are we not doing this? Like how do you expect to make change if you can't hold your own actions accountable? Because when you're responsible for somebody else or somebody else's kids, that elevates it. So, that's what I'm seeing. I guess a lack of teaching, how accountability can actually make you successful and can make change. It just starts with you. And it honestly starts with you, like you can go see a therapist or get analyzed by somebody or go back to whatever source you came from for your motivation for your why. But yeah, that's what I feel like would need to be changed more authentically. And in terms of the media, a lot of these things quite honestly, I guess Madison is still dealing with those issues.

Do we have open honest conversation? Like do we need as many police, or do we need police in schools period. Like really, you really can't handle black kids, really? You think that's hard. No it's not that bad. Just make yourself entertaining, change up the system. Have these conversations, at least start with that. And you know if you want more information, go hire somebody that is actually an expert. So when I hear these things I'm really like, wow, we're on this? There's so many different little issues. Once you get to that level and then don't illusion yourself. Once you learn more and once you get more exposure, you think, oh man, I made progress.

keetra,claude,41,42,"I can go first. I would say I live in Madison and I like Madison because I believe in the possibility of Madison becoming the city that we all want it to be. And what I mean by that is, right now of course there is a tale of two cities, but I think we've reached a spot where people are now aware that there's a tale of two cities, or they are now validated in knowing for a long time that there is a tale of two cities. And in my work I come across a lot of organizational leaders, a lot of people in public office, a lot of everyday people. And what I see time and time again is especially like in smaller groups like this, is that, and I've mentioned this in a speech recently, that we are all able to connect on a human level. We know what's right, we know what looks right, what feels right. And if you think back to the incident where the school behavioral specialists body-slammed a little black girl and snatch braids out of her head regardless of any policy or practice, we know we wouldn't want that to happen to our child. On a human level, that's wrong. It doesn't matter who wrote what policy and what's in place. So I think we're all able to connect and know what the right thing to do is. I think that our challenge is realizing that people, everyday people in our community, make up the systems that interfere with us becoming the city that we want to be. And what I mean by that is, in that same scenario, the school district says, well this person was practicing in line with his role and responsibilities in the school district, so he can't be terminated. We'll refer it to the Madison Police Department. The Police Department says, well, if the School District says he didn't do anything wrong, he didn't break any laws. So there's nothing we can do as a Police Department, we'll refer to the District Attorney's Office. The District Attorney's Office says, well if the police didn't file any charges, there's nothing we can do, because we can't take any legal action. So everybody is pointing the finger at the next person or the next entity as the reason why. But in pointing those fingers we're ultimately pointing our fingers at ourselves, because we made those policies and practices. So I think that once we realize that we are the systems, we are the people who make up the policies and the practices, and it's our relationships, and our friendships, and our professional networks that create this brick wall that we all keep on bump our heads up against, until we realize that we're just going to continue passing the ball. We just have to be brave enough. Like I tell all leaders, this requires brave leadership. People who are not afraid to be disliked, to make those bold calls, to make those really brave choices. That change things to the point where we don't have those excuses or reasons why we can't do X, Y, Z anymore, but we work together to make sure that the right thing is accomplished basically. I believe in our ability to get there. It's frustrating. It's frustrating just to see us continue to bump up against that system and people to see that as the end all be all. It's frustrating for me to see people who are in agreement that change needs to happen until they have to sacrifice something, or something is taken away from that particular person or group of people. There was a quote once that really hit me. It said, when you're accustomed to privilege, equity feels like oppression. So in other words, if you're used to being spoonfed and having your way, when it's time to make sure that everyone has what they need, it feels like something's being taken away from you. But the fact that you had more in the first place is what was wrong all the time. So yeah, that's what I think.","I think to accompanied that, one of the things that I also think Madison's a great place. Great place to raise a family. And one of the things that comforts to help, is that I was able to find a church family, a place where you can go, fellowship. And that's a big part of my existence is that, that's the place where you can feel like you're at home. And that was a big thing that I found in the church I'm in. But I think the challenge is that there is two sides to Madison. And I had to prepare my children about how you need to navigate. And my son is when Casey said, Hey, the police pulled me over on the Beltline, and you tell me why were there three patrol cars that accompanied him. And I said, there's no real easy answer. He said that you are black and they somehow, you're young and they, because his license plate wasn't right. Whatever the reason was. And he wanted to say something. Then I cast, and I said, you do not need to say anything to them. It does not feel right. It's not right. But that's just what happens. And I said, there'll be things that happen to you because of the color of your skin. And I had to prepare all I should, and I said, this does not mean that you are less than, it's just part of the process that will happen to you. But we should not accept that as a standard operation that this should always happen this way. The police need to continue to work on not being so insensitive. And what that's about. If you are not a major criminal, it doesn't require three officers to do that. And I'd been through a lot of experience. So I got my kids ready for that, but hoping that one day, that we don't have to have that conversation that will be like, okay, the police are doing their job and they're treating me like they treat everybody else. But because I'm a black male, I am always aware of that, and I prepared my son, and he said it doesn't seem fair. And I said, it's not fair. But you can rise above it and you rise above it and not let it define you, because these things can define you, especially if you respond in the wrong way. And I've had many encounters from my own personal that I've gone through where I have just had to listen to someone, just DOD trap, all kinds of things that are just ugly in our slate. And I just said, we didn't have anything to say. I said, I had nothing to say, because what I want to say, I can't say, because if I say something, you're going to arrest me. So I just look at them and they'll say, you're awfully calm. Yes I am, because I have to be. But I'm hoping that those instances become less and less and that we end up in this situation, especially from the school situation, that was just like, you should never do that. And if I did anything like that or people then he would be fired immediately. And so there has to be some balance about what is the issue about what's fair and what is right and what is wrong.",1,0.9048374180359595,0.6341044902801514,0.5737614697501003

One of the things I have learned is largely that, if you look back on all the problems you had individually, a lot of it had do with yourself, is that I can't put the blame on somebody else about the things that I contributed to and did. That I said, hey, if it wasn't for so and so or this, I'd be fine. And be accountable. Like you talking about, the accountability starts with yourself and that's a bigger product. And looking in the mirror and then trying to address the issues that you have so that you can go say, all right, I'm better off now, because I've cleaned up my stuff before I go out and I discredit somebody else.

So thank you guys for listening.","I can go first. I would say I live in Madison and I like Madison because I believe in the possibility of Madison becoming the city that we all want it to be. And what I mean by that is, right now of course there is a tale of two cities, but I think we've reached a spot where people are now aware that there's a tale of two cities, or they are now validated in knowing for a long time that there is a tale of two cities. And in my work I come across a lot of organizational leaders, a lot of people in public office, a lot of everyday people. And what I see time and time again is especially like in smaller groups like this, is that, and I've mentioned this in a speech recently, that we are all able to connect on a human level. We know what's right, we know what looks right, what feels right. And if you think back to the incident where the school behavioral specialists body-slammed a little black girl and snatch braids out of her head regardless of any policy or practice, we know we wouldn't want that to happen to our child. On a human level, that's wrong. It doesn't matter who wrote what policy and what's in place. So I think we're all able to connect and know what the right thing to do is. I think that our challenge is realizing that people, everyday people in our community, make up the systems that interfere with us becoming the city that we want to be. And what I mean by that is, in that same scenario, the school district says, well this person was practicing in line with his role and responsibilities in the school district, so he can't be terminated. We'll refer it to the Madison Police Department. The Police Department says, well, if the School District says he didn't do anything wrong, he didn't break any laws. So there's nothing we can do as a Police Department, we'll refer to the District Attorney's Office. The District Attorney's Office says, well if the police didn't file any charges, there's nothing we can do, because we can't take any legal action. So everybody is pointing the finger at the next person or the next entity as the reason why. But in pointing those fingers we're ultimately pointing our fingers at ourselves, because we made those policies and practices. So I think that once we realize that we are the systems, we are the people who make up the policies and the practices, and it's our relationships, and our friendships, and our professional networks that create this brick wall that we all keep on bump our heads up against, until we realize that we're just going to continue passing the ball. We just have to be brave enough. Like I tell all leaders, this requires brave leadership. People who are not afraid to be disliked, to make those bold calls, to make those really brave choices. That change things to the point where we don't have those excuses or reasons why we can't do X, Y, Z anymore, but we work together to make sure that the right thing is accomplished basically. I believe in our ability to get there. It's frustrating. It's frustrating just to see us continue to bump up against that system and people to see that as the end all be all. It's frustrating for me to see people who are in agreement that change needs to happen until they have to sacrifice something, or something is taken away from that particular person or group of people. There was a quote once that really hit me. It said, when you're accustomed to privilege, equity feels like oppression. So in other words, if you're used to being spoonfed and having your way, when it's time to make sure that everyone has what they need, it feels like something's being taken away from you. But the fact that you had more in the first place is what was wrong all the time. So yeah, that's what I think.",4,0.6703200460356393,0.33664971590042114,0.2256630530602552

mikaela,dawn,30,33,And I don't go about in a circle. It starts with things to break a little.,"When you brought up the subject, the first thing that came to my mind is my parents divorced when I was very young. I don't ever remember my biological dad living in the house with us. And I went to private Catholic schools in Madison my whole life. And so that was really like, ""Ooh, you know, your parents are divorced."" You know, that wasn't the thing, or it was really frowned upon. My mom remarried when I was nine, and the gentleman she married became my dad. I still had my biological dad, but he also was my dad to the point where when I got married, they both walked me down the aisle. You know, it was a family. Before I got married, I actually went to both my mother and my father and I said, ""Why did you divorce?"" And to this day... They're both still alive right now. To this day, they will not tell me. They say it's between us. It has nothing to do with you. You know, it's... I have my suspicions, but nobody will tell me why they chose to get divorced. But growing up, I had three parents. I didn't have two. Very active in my life. My biological dad worked for the phone company. When our phone broke, back then it wasn't 50/50 where you went to the parents, it was every other Sunday you went to visit your dad. That's how it was. But he was always coming to the house to check on me, to interact, whatever. And so when our phone would break, my stepdad would call my biological dad and call and say, ""Hey, we need help over here with this."" Or the reverse would happen. My stepdad works at Kaiser's in the Parts Department. He would help out my biological dad if he needed help. So even divorce can be very adversarial, but they showed me at a very young age that we all can just get along and everybody is so much richer and better for it.",3,0.7408182206817179,0.18631823360919952,0.13802794230292784

So thank you guys for listening.","You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?"" ""No, I don't think.""

steve,keetra,67,71,"There you go. So I talked to a lot of my friends that are here and then have moved. My girlfriend is from Mississippi. And a lot of the people, because of the epics and some of the other big companies here that bring balance, becoming a city of transplants almost. It's hard to make friends. It's hard to meet people. It's hard to, I mean even like be in the community. Like I go to the gym every day. I live in an apartment, I see the same people. They never said, hello the me. You go to the supermarket, you don't talk to anybody. I don't know if it's the sign of the times, or we're at like late twenties. This is just what it's like to kind of be living and not, but that's what I feel, it's like that. Tale of two cities or what? Like people aren't even talking to each other within the city, unless they have to, unless they're in the same work group or... I don't know.","I would say the greatest thing about Madison is our diversity. The worst thing about Madison is our diversity, all right? We have so many opportunities. We have more in common than we have different, right? But we can't get past certain things to get to that point. A lot of things that Steve has said today, I'm like, that makes sense. But a lot of times our focus, like we're moving so quickly or living life, trying to make things easier and smoother and technology is moving everything so much faster, that instead of doing the right thing, we're doing the fastest right. Instead of looking for the right answer or the right person we're just seeing what's available and just keeping things moving, and we lose so much in that. And with the situation with like the hello, that is a huge... I learned growing up, a cultural difference between people of color and white people. White people don't say hello. So it's weird for me like when you enter a space, and I've seen this through my kids' friends, they'll bring friends over to the house that are not black. And we have to tell them to teach their friends like when you enter a house, you greet people, you say hello, and it's so hard to learn. I don't get it, but that's... When I was a kid growing up, if you walked in the room and didn't hello, you get popped, period. That's it. Like who are you? You want you... Who do you? You say hi to everybody in here. And so just today, I was in the first of my businesses that I'm prepping this food for this meeting, like Kelly came in, and I'll say, ""Hey."" I was like, ""Hey Kelly."" And she was like, ""Oh my girl, what's wrong with you?"" She's like, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""I just said, Hey Kelly"" and you all like, she's like, ""Oh, I said hi, you didn't hear me?"" And I'm thinking like first of all, no you didn't, but okay, now we're where we need to be. And then we had a little brief conversation, but it's cultural, right? So I can't hold that against her, because she didn't grow up the way that I grew up. But we, it's... There's so many opportunities for us to learn from it. Like, I speak to Steve all the time. It's like, ""Hey."" He's like, ""Hey."" But now to know that you're in an elevator and you don't speak to people like, okay. Right. That's who Steve is and that's how he was raised. So our differences, and sharing our differences is what makes us greater. But with technology and with how quick we're trying to move and do things in the world, we don't stop to take advantage of those opportunities, because we're too busy.",4,0.6703200460356393,0.40905267000198364,0.2741962045867309

I'm like me, I'm gone for three days and then I want to come home. So that's something wild in my eyes. So the reason I chose honesty, one, I'm a pretty blunt person, so I do like to live that value the best I can. And I think it comes from growing up. It's so weird. Don, your story is kind of similar to mine when you started saying that. I don't know my real dad and my mom has never addressed it. It's like something I don't even know. It's like it's never brought up. So then when I was 18 you're given your birth certificate and I did a bunch of research, et cetera. But where I'm going with that is this whole time that I've been growing up, it's like my mom doesn't see me as an adult or like didn't see that she could tell me these things. And really that kind of stemmed over into her just kind of being hands off as a parent in general. So I just, I don't know. I really value honesty because I think if she could talk to me and tell me about it, I feel I deserve that. I deserve to be told what happened and I haven't been, and I just, I don't know. I think that that's where a lot of my being blunt and being open and just talk to people like they're humans, you know? It's also very uncomfortable for me to share.

So I grew up with my grandparents. So there is still... There are certain things that are still instilled in me that I still do.

So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?"" ""No, I don't think."" Because these were things between them and we don't, when I tell him to know all that stuff and it won't help us to go back and sort of re-live history, but it was good to have a conversation about as an adult to ask adult another question.

jalanda,mathias,18,21,"I am in Jalanda. I work here at United Way as well, and I'm born and partially raised in Gary, Indiana and being transplanted here in Madison at an early age. It was a culture shock, and still navigating that with my children, who range in ages from when we are visiting family who are still there, and then coming back to Madison and trying to reconcile the differences, and how they experience the two different places. I would say truly my value is just authenticity and authenticity about oneself, their intentions, how they communicate, how they present. Don't do very well with reading in between the lines or gray. So sometimes the truth hurts, but I'd rather have the authentic truth than anything else.","All right. So right now this next thing we would like to do is, I invite you to share a little bit about your background. Take a minute to think about a personal story from your life that has shaped who you are and what help others understand what's important to you. If it helps, you can reflect on that value. Just select them in the last round and think of a story that illustrates a time when this value has either challenged, or reinforced you. We will go again once. We will just go again once again around the table and just share our story and as a reminder, you're invited to share a personal story that will help other people understand what's important to you. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you don't say anything that you wouldn't want the public to know, or just be open to the community.

jalanda,mathias,31,32,"I can share. So I have a good circle in my mind, like what am I going to say? And something just hit me. So when I say authenticity, in a previous job I worked with undergraduate students, traditionally underrepresented, low income, first generation. And I had entered into one of my colleagues' offices, into of the young women, were sitting at the table just kind of chit chatting and she said something to me in reference to one of the young ladies who was a undergraduate student, but also was a single parent. And because that's something near and dear to my heart, and anybody that knows me, knows I have four kids. And with my first child I just literally just started explaining the experience, and I understand the guilt that she feels. And she's sitting there and tears are just running down her face, because she didn't think anybody would truly understand what she's going through, because most of them that do have children generally try to keep that separate, but she was not in a space or did not have the support to balance that out. And so just hearing that, there was this instant connection. And every time after that, just when she was feeling high stress or, and just dealing with being a single person, I had to balance it or dealing with the guilt. Like we would just connect and having to reassure her, how to deal with that, how to navigate that, how to push through it. And now that she's graduated and totally different perspective, totally different life, but now you're able to share that experience to help the next person. But just being authentic and just saying it ain't easy.",Thank you.,1,0.9048374180359595,0.1083730161190033,0.09805996008988836

jalanda,mathias,60,61,"I, let's see... One of the biggest things is, has been my personal experience and going through the experience with my kids through the Madison School District. I can talk about that for days on end. I would say with my youngest ones right now, the parts I am most struggling with, because my two oldest are girls and my two youngest are boys. So their experience with academics have been completely different. So I always feel like I have to start off the year in a much different way in explaining their learning styles, their interests, how to get them engaged. And this year has probably been the most receptive year, and the teachers actually listening and trying some of the suggestions versus being in a space where it's pulling tug with the kid. And I would say like that first week we kind of have my third grader, his teacher called me and we had this very long conversation. Very, very long conversation, but by the end of it I haven't heard from her since, so everything that I've kind of suggested and helped her have a better understanding of just him, his personality, how he learns best, and she actually was receptive and heard me and implemented this stuff. It's been completely different. Like she used, he comes to school every day, he might sit there but he's like, I hate this flat out. I hate this. I don't want to be here. Now it's like he comes home. How was your day at school? I hate it, but I did it. I'm participating correctly. That's all I ask. But it's more or less kind of, it has been my experience, it's a lack of understanding or the cultural differences and not taking the time to be curious enough to inquire about those. I would say with the girls it's been a lot of preconceived ideas or notions and having those challenged, and then having to deal with the social dynamics of school. There's something, it burns my skin. So my second oldest daughter's only in fourth grade now. So in second grade she came home one day. She was like, well one of the kids say my skin colors, the color of poo. I'm sorry, what? And as a parent, I'm trying to compose myself because everything I want to say to my child that I wouldn't care if you repeat it. I have to keep it on the inside and, but it broke my heart. Like it just, it truly broke my heart. But like what, how are you doing? Like where... So many things are wrong with that and trying so that it doesn't stick with her. So I'm more concerned that she's not stuck with this memory for the rest of her life, and this experience for the rest of her life. That is just how to prepare them at the same time. How to equip them to deal with the trauma that they're going to experience at school. Whether it's from a teacher, whether it's from another student just in general, and not playing down their smarts. The questions in, was the teacher really seeing that they're playing you, like what you're asking them to do and what you're seeing them do, is like completely different things. So when they truly get comfortable and can be the authentic selves and learn. It becomes a different conversation, becomes a different dynamic between the parent and the teacher. Whereas if you had walked into this space with this limited mind frame, this conversation would have happened upfront versus now we're getting the testing, and we need to bring in the academic learning specialists because they are, well we've tried to prepare you for that, but you didn't want to listen, because all you saw was another brown child.

So there is still... There are certain things that are still instilled in me that I still do.

I want to convene all the black people and have a conversation. I want to convene all the Latino's and have a conversation to see what the Latinos want. I'm going to convene on the monks and see what the monks would want. And then after that, a glamour shot, where they are engaging with communities of color, nothing happens. And then the next leader comes in, and it starts all over again. And I actually went to see Mayor Satya in my frustrations, like I told her, this is like a game of musical chairs and you're the only one that's not moving around the seats. Because every time she calls a meeting, I'm sitting here, I sit there, and we just dance. It's the same group of people that you're engaging. I can tell you exactly what you have noted and what you want from this meeting, because it's been the same thing that has come up in the last 20 to 35 meetings we've been sat in and told our leaders what we want out of this community.

I don't ever remember my biological dad living in the house with us. And I went to private Catholic schools in Madison my whole life. And so that was really like, ""Ooh, you know, your parents are divorced."" You know, that wasn't the thing, or it was really frowned upon. My mom remarried when I was nine, and the gentleman she married became my dad. I still had my biological dad, but he also was my dad to the point where when I got married, they both walked me down the aisle. You know, it was a family. Before I got married, I actually went to both my mother and my father and I said, ""Why did you divorce?"" And to this day... They're both still alive right now. To this day, they will not tell me. They say it's between us. It has nothing to do with you. You know, it's... I have my suspicions, but nobody will tell me why they chose to get divorced. But growing up, I had three parents. I didn't have two. Very active in my life. My biological dad worked for the phone company. When our phone broke, back then it wasn't 50/50 where you went to the parents, it was every other Sunday you went to visit your dad. That's how it was. But he was always coming to the house to check on me, to interact, whatever. And so when our phone would break, my stepdad would call my biological dad and call and say, ""Hey, we need help over here with this."" Or the reverse would happen. My stepdad works at Kaiser's in the Parts Department. He would help out my biological dad if he needed help. So even divorce can be very adversarial, but they showed me at a very young age that we all can just get along and everybody is so much richer and better for it.",2,0.8187307530779818,0.45336803793907166,0.3711863551233432
jalanda,dawn,60,62,"I, let's see... One of the biggest things is, has been my personal experience and going through the experience with my kids through the Madison School District. I can talk about that for days on end. I would say with my youngest ones right now, the parts I am most struggling with, because my two oldest are girls and my two youngest are boys. So their experience with academics have been completely different. So I always feel like I have to start off the year in a much different way in explaining their learning styles, their interests, how to get them engaged. And this year has probably been the most receptive year, and the teachers actually listening and trying some of the suggestions versus being in a space where it's pulling tug with the kid. And I would say like that first week we kind of have my third grader, his teacher called me and we had this very long conversation.

How was your day at school? I hate it, but I did it. I'm participating correctly. That's all I ask. But it's more or less kind of, it has been my experience, it's a lack of understanding or the cultural differences and not taking the time to be curious enough to inquire about those. I would say with the girls it's been a lot of preconceived ideas or notions and having those challenged, and then having to deal with the social dynamics of school. There's something, it burns my skin. So my second oldest daughter's only in fourth grade now. So in second grade she came home one day.

How to equip them to deal with the trauma that they're going to experience at school. Whether it's from a teacher, whether it's from another student just in general, and not playing down their smarts. The questions in, was the teacher really seeing that they're playing you, like what you're asking them to do and what you're seeing them do, is like completely different things.

We really all bonded and when we still see each other to this day, it's like that friend you don't see for a long time, you know that you still bond.

It's like a new beginning, a new hope that I think that really has to go within. And the lakes. I really enjoy the lakes and all these things. Even the smells of Madison bring me back to things I did when I was a little kid. All the way down to that icky smell, when the lakes get really bad. That brings good memories to me, because as a kid we didn't have pools, we didn't have the Goodman Pool. We went to buy lists and we went, I don't know how I swam it, but we did. It was much... But what concerns me the most is what you said Keetra, the tale of two cities. I don't know if it's because I'm an adult now, and I see that. Where when I was a kid we were all just friends. But now I see the diversity and the pulling apart and it does break my heart to hear the stories of what's happening in the schools. And to see people fighting against each other.

So there is still... There are certain things that are still instilled in me that I still do. So at the grocery store, if I see another person of color, there's still a hello, even if you're just passing, I don't have to know you, but there's still like acknowledge that there's a another person there. I don't know if some of it is just the change of society. I don't know if it's just generational. I don't know if it's that comradery, because we have so many shared lived experience.

That's your secondary kind of family, because if something goes wrong then at least I know that you have connected with somebody else in that building. So that's a little bit more reassuring for me. So some of it I feel like it is just in how, or what was instilled in you or how you kind of grew up, and how you pass some of that along.

I'm from the South, so we grew up as sharecroppers for the first 12 years of our lives. So that means that we did not have a place over our head that we controlled. So, share crop as you worked the land of where you lived, and so we had very humble beginnings. The place were without no running water, no bathroom. You can get water from the spring and did that for a long time. And what you realize is that every day that you're dependent, that where you live depends on how much work you do in terms of what the owners, of picking cotton and grapes and whatever they have asked us to do. And I remember this one day my father was always working two jobs plus doing the work that Atlanta would ask. And so one day, it was a Saturday, and the owner had come and demanded that my father do some work. And I was about seven or eight and my father looked at him and told him no, my father was an old, tough guy. And so he was in the army, so he had a knife with him. He told the man, if he gets out of this truck, that will be his last move of the day. And I watched my father as his knife popped out. And this man, looked at my father, my father looked at him, and he did not get out of the truck. He got back in the truck and he left. And I remember thinking, because my father told me about, you have to draw a line in the sand and sometimes stand your ground and say that enough is enough. So the next day, you have to understand the South back then, is that it was very segregated and they did not give blacks much in terms of that. But the next day 25 white kids marched on our house as a protest for my father who refused to work. Now I'm from a family that's pretty tough. And so as they approached on, one of my sisters asked who was the leader, and he was once spoke up, she kind of whacked him with a poken and he went down, and then somebody else said something, and she whacked him down. And then they all left and we thought, well, either we have caused some problems or whatever. I used to be.. My sis, I thought she was going to come out and do some negotiation. She just took him out and I said, maybe you shouldn't have used the iron. Just ask him who the leader was. She took out two of them. She goes, yes, I would have taken out more. But it's that, meaning the understanding is that you have to fight for yourself. And they didn't bother us anymore after that, they just decided that my sister was kind of crazy and that you probably should leave these folks alone, and that my father would be willing to take people out. So it was like, okay. And it taught me a lesson about I have learn to stand my ground. And as a person of color, I've had to do a lot of that. When I said, I have to stand alone about what I believe in and I will fight for it until the day of the time and that you have to take me out. And they said, what do you mean by that? I said, I mean take me out, because I will defend myself. And that lesson as a seven, eight year old, is really stuck with me even to this day, even though we're in different times. There were moments where you feel like you are under assault, because somebody decides not to treat you as an equal. So that's my story and it's deep within my DNA and I still think about it.",4,0.6703200460356393,0.4071391820907593,0.2729135552819903

dawn,keetra,69,71,"So it makes me wonder, if this piece of technology is what's causing the divide. You know.","I would say the greatest thing about Madison is our diversity. The worst thing about Madison is our diversity, all right? We have so many opportunities. We have more in common than we have different, right? But we can't get past certain things to get to that point. A lot of things that Steve has said today, I'm like, that makes sense. But a lot of times our focus, like we're moving so quickly or living life, trying to make things easier and smoother and technology is moving everything so much faster, that instead of doing the right thing, we're doing the fastest right. Instead of looking for the right answer or the right person we're just seeing what's available and just keeping things moving, and we lose so much in that. And with the situation with like the hello, that is a huge... I learned growing up, a cultural difference between people of color and white people. White people don't say hello. So it's weird for me like when you enter a space, and I've seen this through my kids' friends, they'll bring friends over to the house that are not black. And we have to tell them to teach their friends like when you enter a house, you greet people, you say hello, and it's so hard to learn. I don't get it, but that's... When I was a kid growing up, if you walked in the room and didn't hello, you get popped, period. That's it. Like who are you? You want you... Who do you? You say hi to everybody in here. And so just today, I was in the first of my businesses that I'm prepping this food for this meeting, like Kelly came in, and I'll say, ""Hey."" I was like, ""Hey Kelly."" And she was like, ""Oh my girl, what's wrong with you?"" She's like, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""I just said, Hey Kelly"" and you all like, she's like, ""Oh, I said hi, you didn't hear me?"" And I'm thinking like first of all, no you didn't, but okay, now we're where we need to be. And then we had a little brief conversation, but it's cultural, right? So I can't hold that against her, because she didn't grow up the way that I grew up. But we, it's... There's so many opportunities for us to learn from it. Like, I speak to Steve all the time. It's like, ""Hey."" He's like, ""Hey."" But now to know that you're in an elevator and you don't speak to people like, okay. Right. That's who Steve is and that's how he was raised. So our differences, and sharing our differences is what makes us greater. But with technology and with how quick we're trying to move and do things in the world, we don't stop to take advantage of those opportunities, because we're too busy.",2,0.8187307530779818,0.2665843963623047,0.2182608435925489

I want to convene all the black people and have a conversation. I want to convene all the Latino's and have a conversation to see what the Latinos want. I'm going to convene on the monks and see what the monks would want. And then after that, a glamour shot, where they are engaging with communities of color, nothing happens. And then the next leader comes in, and it starts all over again. And I actually went to see Mayor Satya in my frustrations, like I told her, this is like a game of musical chairs and you're the only one that's not moving around the seats. Because every time she calls a meeting, I'm sitting here, I sit there, and we just dance. It's the same group of people that you're engaging. I can tell you exactly what you have noted and what you want from this meeting, because it's been the same thing that has come up in the last 20 to 35 meetings we've been sat in and told our leaders what we want out of this community.

It's like it's never brought up. So then when I was 18 you're given your birth certificate and I did a bunch of research, et cetera. But where I'm going with that is this whole time that I've been growing up, it's like my mom doesn't see me as an adult or like didn't see that she could tell me these things. And really that kind of stemmed over into her just kind of being hands off as a parent in general. So I just, I don't know.

The crux of my experience there was, here's this 19 year old kid with a whole bunch of false confidence going across the sea, a huge power dynamic to spread the word of God or whatever, and really what could I do for these people? Sharpen, listen, I mean that's what I came back with was this, this humility from my experience of you don't know nearly as much as you think you do. You need to listen twice as much as you speak. And that's kind of why I came back to work for United Ways. Like where can I start improving? It's my own backyard kind of thing. What I know, best is here. And I'm here for a reason. It's, I don't know as much as I need to, to start that.",2,0.8187307530779818,0.40321165323257446,0.3301217805009238

So I grew up with my grandparents. So there is still... There are certain things that are still instilled in me that I still do. So at the grocery store, if I see another person of color, there's still a hello, even if you're just passing, I don't have to know you, but there's still like acknowledge that there's a another person there. I don't know if some of it is just the change of society. I don't know if it's just generational. I don't know if it's that comradery, because we have so many shared lived experience. So we understand what it's like being in that space, and just feeling like you are invisible. But again, that's the whole tale of two city thing where I don't, I care enough, the number of times just going through the store and just hello, hi, and you just keep walking. And even an adult. So with my oldest just moving out into their apartment, I was having the same conversation. Well do you know your neighbors? And for me growing up, that was almost like a security thing. That's your secondary kind of family, because if something goes wrong then at least I know that you have connected with somebody else in that building. So that's a little bit more reassuring for me. So some of it I feel like it is just in how, or what was instilled in you or how you kind of grew up, and how you pass some of that along. So when I go out, I know she knows who that person is, and who's that person, so if I needed to get, I couldn't get in contact, I know that, you know her comings and goings.

I'm from the South, so we grew up as sharecroppers for the first 12 years of our lives. So that means that we did not have a place over our head that we controlled. So, share crop as you worked the land of where you lived, and so we had very humble beginnings. The place were without no running water, no bathroom. You can get water from the spring and did that for a long time. And what you realize is that every day that you're dependent, that where you live depends on how much work you do in terms of what the owners, of picking cotton and grapes and whatever they have asked us to do. And I remember this one day my father was always working two jobs plus doing the work that Atlanta would ask. And so one day, it was a Saturday, and the owner had come and demanded that my father do some work. And I was about seven or eight and my father looked at him and told him no, my father was an old, tough guy. And so he was in the army, so he had a knife with him. He told the man, if he gets out of this truck, that will be his last move of the day. And I watched my father as his knife popped out. And this man, looked at my father, my father looked at him, and he did not get out of the truck. He got back in the truck and he left. And I remember thinking, because my father told me about, you have to draw a line in the sand and sometimes stand your ground and say that enough is enough. So the next day, you have to understand the South back then, is that it was very segregated and they did not give blacks much in terms of that. But the next day 25 white kids marched on our house as a protest for my father who refused to work. Now I'm from a family that's pretty tough. And so as they approached on, one of my sisters asked who was the leader, and he was once spoke up, she kind of whacked him with a poken and he went down, and then somebody else said something, and she whacked him down. And then they all left and we thought, well, either we have caused some problems or whatever. I used to be.. My sis, I thought she was going to come out and do some negotiation. She just took him out and I said, maybe you shouldn't have used the iron. Just ask him who the leader was. She took out two of them. She goes, yes, I would have taken out more. But it's that, meaning the understanding is that you have to fight for yourself. And they didn't bother us anymore after that, they just decided that my sister was kind of crazy and that you probably should leave these folks alone, and that my father would be willing to take people out. So it was like, okay. And it taught me a lesson about I have learn to stand my ground. And as a person of color, I've had to do a lot of that. When I said, I have to stand alone about what I believe in and I will fight for it until the day of the time and that you have to take me out. And they said, what do you mean by that? I said, I mean take me out, because I will defend myself. And that lesson as a seven, eight year old, is really stuck with me even to this day, even though we're in different times.

claude,mathias,39,40,"You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?"" ""No, I don't think."" Because these were things between them and we don't, when I tell him to know all that stuff and it won't help us to go back and sort of re-live history, but it was good to have a conversation about as an adult to ask adult another question. And I remember my brother never forgave him for the drinking, but I had to forgive him, because you can't live with holding that against someone for the rest of your life. Then you will not know when you get into trouble. All of us fall short, so I just remember having a better relationship when you can talk to them as an adult. But they're still, they remind you, I'm still your dad. Don't get confused about that. My mom would yell. She goes, yeah, but I can still take your eyes. Okay. Okay, you know, that's the respectful.","Well, thank you for sharing. Then I'm going to move us along to the next section. This one's more community focused. We want to move on to conversation about your hopes and concerns for your community. So I got a few questions start us off, but we hope this will be a time for you guys to just essentially go back and forth amongst each other's stories. And the two questions that you can either choose to answer both, or one or the other is, first one, what do you like most about living here? Share a story from your experience that will help us give a better picture of what you like and why. And then the other question is what most concerns you about life in this community these days? And can you also share a story from your experiences that will help us understand this concern a little bit better?",1,0.9048374180359595,0.30908671021461487,0.27967322081982093

Originally from South Carolina so I'm a transplant. I've been here since 1969. I do still consider myself a Southerner. I've never acclimated to the weather here. Look, I like looking out the window and it's snow and it should just stay that way and I don't have to be out in it. I work at United Way. I've been a volunteer here for a long, quite a while and I'm a Loan Executive and I love the passion and what United Way stands for. My passion, I'm a deacon in Mount Zion Church, so my passion is about service and servant hood and what it means to be a servant. And so that is what I believe in and things that equal that to have some authenticity to it. It's important to me and also important to me that we do all we can to help those who are not so blessed.

claude,devin,22,24,"I was sharing a story. I'm from the South, so we grew up as sharecroppers for the first 12 years of our lives. So that means that we did not have a place over our head that we controlled. So, share crop as you worked the land of where you lived, and so we had very humble beginnings. The place were without no running water, no bathroom. You can get water from the spring and did that for a long time. And what you realize is that every day that you're dependent, that where you live depends on how much work you do in terms of what the owners, of picking cotton and grapes and whatever they have asked us to do. And I remember this one day my father was always working two jobs plus doing the work that Atlanta would ask. And so one day, it was a Saturday, and the owner had come and demanded that my father do some work. And I was about seven or eight and my father looked at him and told him no, my father was an old, tough guy. And so he was in the army, so he had a knife with him. He told the man, if he gets out of this truck, that will be his last move of the day. And I watched my father as his knife popped out. And this man, looked at my father, my father looked at him, and he did not get out of the truck. He got back in the truck and he left. And I remember thinking, because my father told me about, you have to draw a line in the sand and sometimes stand your ground and say that enough is enough. So the next day, you have to understand the South back then, is that it was very segregated and they did not give blacks much in terms of that. But the next day 25 white kids marched on our house as a protest for my father who refused to work. Now I'm from a family that's pretty tough. And so as they approached on, one of my sisters asked who was the leader, and he was once spoke up, she kind of whacked him with a poken and he went down, and then somebody else said something, and she whacked him down. And then they all left and we thought, well, either we have caused some problems or whatever. I used to be.. My sis, I thought she was going to come out and do some negotiation. She just took him out and I said, maybe you shouldn't have used the iron. Just ask him who the leader was. She took out two of them. She goes, yes, I would have taken out more. But it's that, meaning the understanding is that you have to fight for yourself. And they didn't bother us anymore after that, they just decided that my sister was kind of crazy and that you probably should leave these folks alone, and that my father would be willing to take people out. So it was like, okay. And it taught me a lesson about I have learn to stand my ground. And as a person of color, I've had to do a lot of that. When I said, I have to stand alone about what I believe in and I will fight for it until the day of the time and that you have to take me out. And they said, what do you mean by that? I said, I mean take me out, because I will defend myself. And that lesson as a seven, eight year old, is really stuck with me even to this day, even though we're in different times. There were moments where you feel like you are under assault, because somebody decides not to treat you as an equal. So that's my story and it's deep within my DNA and I still think about it.","I guess I have a story about why I switched my college major to Communication Studies.

I know where everything is for the most part. So that's the convenient part that I really enjoy. The part that I wish Madison maybe could be improved on is exposure of other communities because if you go five hours away to the twin cities, there is a level of exposure that you can only get from being there and from living there. Like you would have to live there for at least like two to three months to know what authentic community action can look like and would look like. There was a protest recently where the president came in and honestly I was like, why did I move so soon? I could have been there with one of my friends. But at the same time I knew I left, because I didn't want to pay rent and for a couple of other reasons, but I did miss that authenticity and there was just a level of community action diversity that was really authentic. Like you can talk to a random person and sure enough you both might be in a similar same circle. And you know, there's just some things that I wish I could take from that exposure to open it to hear. And there's a level of accountability and responsibility that a lot of different generations that you may not see, have going on. Especially in youth work. It's definitely not highlighted here. It's definitely not the norm here. Even when I talk to my friends, it's like, oh, you're not holding yourself accountable on that. Okay. All right, cool. That's different. I got used to that. So it's just like, why are we not doing this? Like how do you expect to make change if you can't hold your own actions accountable? Because when you're responsible for somebody else or somebody else's kids, that elevates it. So, that's what I'm seeing. I guess a lack of teaching, how accountability can actually make you successful and can make change. It just starts with you. And it honestly starts with you, like you can go see a therapist or get analyzed by somebody or go back to whatever source you came from for your motivation for your why. But yeah, that's what I feel like would need to be changed more authentically. And in terms of the media, a lot of these things quite honestly, I guess Madison is still dealing with those issues. But to me now, those issues are a little bit old and now it's more of like the instant gratification of RI. You know what goes really on in a police man's daily life, how do we change that? Do we have open honest conversation? Like do we need as many police, or do we need police in schools period. Like really, you really can't handle black kids, really? You think that's hard. No it's not that bad. Just make yourself entertaining, change up the system. Have these conversations, at least start with that. And you know if you want more information, go hire somebody that is actually an expert. So when I hear these things I'm really like, wow, we're on this? There's so many different little issues. Once you get to that level and then don't illusion yourself. Once you learn more and once you get more exposure, you think, oh man, I made progress. So much more intergenerational, intercultural, there's just so much more that can happen. So I guess that's another thing of saying, we call it journey to change things.

And the reason that my father wasn't in my life was, because he was incarcerated. And the reason that he was incarcerated was because he couldn't find a job. The reason he couldn't find a job is there's a lot of instances he was discriminated against, and making illegal money in some situations became the only way to make money. So not only was my father in prison, all of his brothers were also in prison. And so I grew up as a little kid going to visit men that I love in prison. And so one thing that it did, was life scared me completely straight. Like, ""Hey, it's not for me."" But another thing that it did, is made systemic racism very real to me in my life every day. And then growing up in Chicago, I would be around, just in the neighborhood. Other people who were headed down similar paths, because of the limited opportunities they had for survival. I saw how people from outside of the community benefited from the corruption of the community. Police officers giving drugs to people to sell. Like it's just, that's the way business happens. That's the way things are done. Then it's time for punishment. People who were either dying or going to jail look a lot like me, and that has made poverty and all of the specific symptoms of poverty or whatever shape that plays, homelessness, incarceration, joblessness, lack of education. All of those things allow me to see those people as people, and people who are just trying really hard to push up against the system that's designed to keep them exactly where they are. And that's why I do the work that I do. And that is what drives me every day. Just knowing that people are all human. We all want great things for our families.

claude,keetra,39,41,"You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?"" ""No, I don't think."" Because these were things between them and we don't, when I tell him to know all that stuff and it won't help us to go back and sort of re-live history, but it was good to have a conversation about as an adult to ask adult another question. And I remember my brother never forgave him for the drinking, but I had to forgive him, because you can't live with holding that against someone for the rest of your life. Then you will not know when you get into trouble. All of us fall short, so I just remember having a better relationship when you can talk to them as an adult. But they're still, they remind you, I'm still your dad. Don't get confused about that. My mom would yell. She goes, yeah, but I can still take your eyes. Okay. Okay, you know, that's the respectful.","I can go first. I would say I live in Madison and I like Madison because I believe in the possibility of Madison becoming the city that we all want it to be. And what I mean by that is, right now of course there is a tale of two cities, but I think we've reached a spot where people are now aware that there's a tale of two cities, or they are now validated in knowing for a long time that there is a tale of two cities. And in my work I come across a lot of organizational leaders, a lot of people in public office, a lot of everyday people. And what I see time and time again is especially like in smaller groups like this, is that, and I've mentioned this in a speech recently, that we are all able to connect on a human level. We know what's right, we know what looks right, what feels right. And if you think back to the incident where the school behavioral specialists body-slammed a little black girl and snatch braids out of her head regardless of any policy or practice, we know we wouldn't want that to happen to our child. On a human level, that's wrong. It doesn't matter who wrote what policy and what's in place. So I think we're all able to connect and know what the right thing to do is. I think that our challenge is realizing that people, everyday people in our community, make up the systems that interfere with us becoming the city that we want to be. And what I mean by that is, in that same scenario, the school district says, well this person was practicing in line with his role and responsibilities in the school district, so he can't be terminated. We'll refer it to the Madison Police Department. The Police Department says, well, if the School District says he didn't do anything wrong, he didn't break any laws. So there's nothing we can do as a Police Department, we'll refer to the District Attorney's Office. The District Attorney's Office says, well if the police didn't file any charges, there's nothing we can do, because we can't take any legal action. So everybody is pointing the finger at the next person or the next entity as the reason why. But in pointing those fingers we're ultimately pointing our fingers at ourselves, because we made those policies and practices. So I think that once we realize that we are the systems, we are the people who make up the policies and the practices, and it's our relationships, and our friendships, and our professional networks that create this brick wall that we all keep on bump our heads up against, until we realize that we're just going to continue passing the ball. We just have to be brave enough. Like I tell all leaders, this requires brave leadership. People who are not afraid to be disliked, to make those bold calls, to make those really brave choices. That change things to the point where we don't have those excuses or reasons why we can't do X, Y, Z anymore, but we work together to make sure that the right thing is accomplished basically. I believe in our ability to get there. It's frustrating. It's frustrating just to see us continue to bump up against that system and people to see that as the end all be all. It's frustrating for me to see people who are in agreement that change needs to happen until they have to sacrifice something, or something is taken away from that particular person or group of people. There was a quote once that really hit me. It said, when you're accustomed to privilege, equity feels like oppression. So in other words, if you're used to being spoonfed and having your way, when it's time to make sure that everyone has what they need, it feels like something's being taken away from you. But the fact that you had more in the first place is what was wrong all the time. So yeah, that's what I think.",2,0.8187307530779818,0.4416450560092926,0.3615883892996556
claude,keetra,39,43,"You know, that's interesting that you share that, because you know there are things that happen young, with your parents never tell you about. So my father was an alcoholic until he was 50. And so when you grow up with somebody who's alcoholic, he wasn't abusive. He just would drink and go away for days and days and days and then come back home. And so, you have to resolve yourself to forgive someone, because when you're young you realize that he's the provider and if he doesn't come home, how do we survive? And so I remember wanting to try to ask him when, how did he stop drinking? And what led him to do that? And I think when I moved to Madison, I had just gotten my first job as the Hospital Administrator of Mendota. So being the first black hired there and I had my parents come up to visit me when I just moved to Madison, they wanted. My mom had been on dialysis for a long time, and she was getting toward the end stage and wanting to make sure all the children were okay. So she came to see me for the first time and it was constantly a hassle here, and I had four days with them. So I got to ask my father questions that I never asked. I said, ""Dad, I have some questions for you."" And so he told me that he decided to stop drinking because, one is, I think my mom told him that she was going to leave him, which is something back then people denied divorce. They were like for life. And then his large brothers, he's a Mason and several of them rescued him, told him that they, this was their last time doing the intervention. It's like people telling him, you have to stop or you're done. And then he stopped drinking, was no church intervention. He didn't... He just stopped and never touched it. Rock for the rest of his life. And I remember asking him about that news, several other questions that you have, but there were other things that they wouldn't answer, I said, ""Could you answer me these other questions?"" ""No, I don't think."" Because these were things between them and we don't, when I tell him to know all that stuff and it won't help us to go back and sort of re-live history, but it was good to have a conversation about as an adult to ask adult another question. And I remember my brother never forgave him for the drinking, but I had to forgive him, because you can't live with holding that against someone for the rest of your life. Then you will not know when you get into trouble. All of us fall short, so I just remember having a better relationship when you can talk to them as an adult. But they're still, they remind you, I'm still your dad. Don't get confused about that. My mom would yell. She goes, yeah, but I can still take your eyes. Okay.

claude,mikaela,22,26,"I was sharing a story. I'm from the South, so we grew up as sharecroppers for the first 12 years of our lives. So that means that we did not have a place over our head that we controlled. So, share crop as you worked the land of where you lived, and so we had very humble beginnings. The place were without no running water, no bathroom. You can get water from the spring and did that for a long time. And what you realize is that every day that you're dependent, that where you live depends on how much work you do in terms of what the owners, of picking cotton and grapes and whatever they have asked us to do. And I remember this one day my father was always working two jobs plus doing the work that Atlanta would ask. And so one day, it was a Saturday, and the owner had come and demanded that my father do some work. And I was about seven or eight and my father looked at him and told him no, my father was an old, tough guy. And so he was in the army, so he had a knife with him. He told the man, if he gets out of this truck, that will be his last move of the day. And I watched my father as his knife popped out. And this man, looked at my father, my father looked at him, and he did not get out of the truck. He got back in the truck and he left. And I remember thinking, because my father told me about, you have to draw a line in the sand and sometimes stand your ground and say that enough is enough. So the next day, you have to understand the South back then, is that it was very segregated and they did not give blacks much in terms of that. But the next day 25 white kids marched on our house as a protest for my father who refused to work. Now I'm from a family that's pretty tough. And so as they approached on, one of my sisters asked who was the leader, and he was once spoke up, she kind of whacked him with a poken and he went down, and then somebody else said something, and she whacked him down. And then they all left and we thought, well, either we have caused some problems or whatever. I used to be.. My sis, I thought she was going to come out and do some negotiation. She just took him out and I said, maybe you shouldn't have used the iron. Just ask him who the leader was. She took out two of them. She goes, yes, I would have taken out more. But it's that, meaning the understanding is that you have to fight for yourself. And they didn't bother us anymore after that, they just decided that my sister was kind of crazy and that you probably should leave these folks alone, and that my father would be willing to take people out. So it was like, okay. And it taught me a lesson about I have learn to stand my ground. And as a person of color, I've had to do a lot of that. When I said, I have to stand alone about what I believe in and I will fight for it until the day of the time and that you have to take me out. And they said, what do you mean by that? I said, I mean take me out, because I will defend myself. And that lesson as a seven, eight year old, is really stuck with me even to this day, even though we're in different times. There were moments where you feel like you are under assault, because somebody decides not to treat you as an equal.

claude,jalanda,58,60,"Just tell the truth, whatever it is.","I, let's see... One of the biggest things is, has been my personal experience and going through the experience with my kids through the Madison School District. I can talk about that for days on end. I would say with my youngest ones right now, the parts I am most struggling with, because my two oldest are girls and my two youngest are boys. So their experience with academics have been completely different. So I always feel like I have to start off the year in a much different way in explaining their learning styles, their interests, how to get them engaged. And this year has probably been the most receptive year, and the teachers actually listening and trying some of the suggestions versus being in a space where it's pulling tug with the kid. And I would say like that first week we kind of have my third grader, his teacher called me and we had this very long conversation. Very, very long conversation, but by the end of it I haven't heard from her since, so everything that I've kind of suggested and helped her have a better understanding of just him, his personality, how he learns best, and she actually was receptive and heard me and implemented this stuff. It's been completely different. Like she used, he comes to school every day, he might sit there but he's like, I hate this flat out. I hate this. I don't want to be here. Now it's like he comes home. How was your day at school? I hate it, but I did it. I'm participating correctly. That's all I ask. But it's more or less kind of, it has been my experience, it's a lack of understanding or the cultural differences and not taking the time to be curious enough to inquire about those. I would say with the girls it's been a lot of preconceived ideas or notions and having those challenged, and then having to deal with the social dynamics of school. There's something, it burns my skin. So my second oldest daughter's only in fourth grade now. So in second grade she came home one day. She was like, well one of the kids say my skin colors, the color of poo. I'm sorry, what? And as a parent, I'm trying to compose myself because everything I want to say to my child that I wouldn't care if you repeat it. I have to keep it on the inside and, but it broke my heart. Like it just, it truly broke my heart. But like what, how are you doing? Like where... So many things are wrong with that and trying so that it doesn't stick with her. So I'm more concerned that she's not stuck with this memory for the rest of her life, and this experience for the rest of her life. That is just how to prepare them at the same time. How to equip them to deal with the trauma that they're going to experience at school. Whether it's from a teacher, whether it's from another student just in general, and not playing down their smarts. The questions in, was the teacher really seeing that they're playing you, like what you're asking them to do and what you're seeing them do, is like completely different things. So when they truly get comfortable and can be the authentic selves and learn. It becomes a different conversation, becomes a different dynamic between the parent and the teacher. Whereas if you had walked into this space with this limited mind frame, this conversation would have happened upfront versus now we're getting the testing, and we need to bring in the academic learning specialists because they are, well we've tried to prepare you for that, but you didn't want to listen, because all you saw was another brown child.
